"""
Implement a few effective medium approximation formulas...

Both material dielectric models and EMAs usually work with dielec permittivity
and refractive index is derived as sqrt(eps), hence this modules is implemented
to always take eps as arguments of both the eps and n functions for
computational efficiency

This module works using just unitless quantities. Which is amazing by itself
but also solves a lot of implementation problems :)

The module can be also used as a standalone python script.

Example
-------
The python script is callable as

    $ python mixing.py refractive_indices volume_fractions

and returns the complex refractive index of the mixture

Notes
-----
    It is possible to call the functions implemented in this module using
    nd-arrays. The function arguments must either have exactly the same
    shape allowing element-wise application of the functions or one of
    the two must be a scalar which will be spread across the nd computations

Refractive indexes should be complex values.

       The MG relation for effective medium approximation is derived for the 
       case of small, highly diluted, spatially well separated, optically soft
       and spherical inclusions in a medium. Also the size of the considered
       volume should be small.
       
       The MG relation is asymmetric, the order of medium and inclusion in the
       formula counts. This is a consequence of the aformentioned assumptions.
