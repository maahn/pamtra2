pyPamtra2
#########


This is the python module refractive.
This module is part of the larger pyPamtra2 software suite for the simulation of consistent radiative transfer between active and passive observations mainly at microwave frequencies.
The module computes the complex refractive index of ice and water between 1 and 1000 GHz.
The functionalities of this module can be used outside of pyPamtra2 in any other application.
