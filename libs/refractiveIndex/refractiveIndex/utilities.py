This module provides a short list of utilities and complementary functions
for the refractive index module.

Basic conversion from refractive index to dielectric permittivity
(and viceversa) is implemented.
The module also provides a conversion function from dielectric permittivity to
radar dielectric factor K2 which is of great importance in radar applications
