This module computes snow dielectric properties as a homogeneous mixture of
ice and air or maybe even other stuff ...

The module can be also used as a standalone python script.

Example
-------
The python script is callable as

    $ python snow.py Temperature Frequency Density

and returns the complex refractive index of snow at the requested
Temperature [Kelvin], Frequency [Hz] and density [kg/m**3]

Notes
-----
    It is possible to call the functions implemented in this module using
    nd-arrays. The function arguments must either have exactly the same
    shape allowing element-wise application of the functions or one of
    the two must be a scalar which will be spread across the nd computations

Temperature should be provided in Kelvin, frequency in Hz and density in kg/m**3
The dielectric module checks for arguments values to be within the
limits of validity of the dielectric model and raises ValueError in case
they are not respected
