scattering - single scattering properties of particles
#########


This is the python module scattering.
This module is part of the larger pyPamtra2 software suite for the simulation of consistent radiative transfer between active and passive observations mainly at microwave frequencies.
The module computes the single scattering properties of hydrometeor models using diverse electromagnetic scattering simulators.
The functionalities of this module can be used outside of pyPamtra2 in any other application.

include
* Rayleigh approximation for spheres
* Rayleigh approximation for spheroids
* Lorenz-Mie scattering solution for spheres
* Self-Similar Rayleigh Gans
* T-Matrix for spheroids
* Scattering DataBases (DBs) - Liu, Hong, Leinonen
